"The decentralization movement is ambitious and will provide awesome "
"opportunities for new social and economic interactions. Decentralization also "
"provides a counterbalance to abuses and corruption that occasionally occur in "
"large organizations where power is concentrated. Decentralization supports self-"
"determination and the rights of individuals to self-organize. Of course, the "
"realities of a more decentralized world will also have its challenges and "
"issues, such as how the needs of international law, public good, and compassion "
"will be honored."

"去中心化运动雄心勃勃，将为新的社会和经济提供绝佳的机遇。同时，去中心化平衡了权力"

"出现。当然，分散的社区组织也将会面临挑战和问题，如法律问题，公共利益如何兑现等问"

"We admire the awesome innovations of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other platforms "
"that have dramatically advanced the state of decentralized systems and ushered "
"in this new age of cryptocurrency and smart contracts. However, we also see "
"symptoms that those projects did not use the best engineering and formal models "
"for scaling and correctness in order to support mission-critical solutions. The "
"ongoing debates about scaling and reliability are symptomatic of foundational "
"architectural issues. For example, is it a scalable design to insist on an "
"explicit serialized processing order for all of a blockchain's transactions "
"conducted on planet earth?"
msgstr ""
"我们非常欣赏比特币，以太坊和其他平台的巨大创新，这些平台大大推进了去中心化组织的"
"发展，迎来了加密货币和智能合约的新时代。但是，我们也看到这些项目没有使用最好的工"
"程模型以支持扩展。目前社区正在热烈讨论的扩容问题和可靠性问题正反应了这些平台底层"
"架构的不足。例如，对于在地球上进行的所有区块链交易，坚持一个明确的序列化处理顺序"
"是否是可扩展的设计？"

"To become a blockchain solution with industrial-scale utility, RChain must "
"provide content delivery at the scale of Facebook and support transactions at "
"the speed of Visa. After due diligence on the current state of many blockchain "
"projects, after deep collaboration with other blockchain developers, and after "
"understanding their respective roadmaps, we concluded that the current and near-"
"term Blockchain architectures cannot meet these requirements. In mid-2016, we "
"resolved to build a better blockchain architecture."

"Building quality software is challenging. It is easier to build \"clever\" "
"software; however, the resulting software is often of poor quality, riddled "
"with bugs, difficult to maintain, and difficult to evolve. Inheriting and "
"working on such software can be hellish for development teams, not to mention "
"their customers. When building an open-source system to support a mission-"
"critical economy, we reject a minimal-success mindset in favor of end-to-end "
"correctness."
