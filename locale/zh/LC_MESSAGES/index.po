"The RChain Platform Architecture description provides a high-level "
"blueprint of the RChain decentralized, economically sustainable public "
"compute infrastructure. While the RChain design is inspired by that of "
"earlier blockchains, it also realizes decades of research across the "
"fields of concurrent and distributed computation, mathematics, and "
"programming language design. The platform includes a modular, end-to-end "
"design that commits to correct-by-construction software and industrial "
"extensibility."
