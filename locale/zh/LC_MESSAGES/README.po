"The RChain platform architecture description provides a high-level "
"blueprint to build a decentralized, economically sustainable public "
"compute infrastructure. The RChain design is inspired by that of earlier "
"blockchains; it unifies decades of research across the fields of "
"concurrent and distributed computation, formal semantics, and programming"
" language design. The RChain platform boasts a modular, end-to-end design"
" that commits to correct-by-construction software and industrial "
"extensibility."
