"This concurrency, which is designed around on the formal models of "
"mobile process calculi, along with an application of compositional "
"namespaces, allows for what are in effect *multiple blockchains per "

"instances is in sharp contrast to a “global compute” design which "
"constrains transactions to be executed sequentially, on a single virtual "
"machine. In addition, each node can be configured to subscribe to and "
"process the namespaces (blockchains) in which it is interested."

"Like other blockchains, achieving consensus across nodes on the state of "
"the blockchain is essential. RChain's protocol for replication and "
"consensus is called Casper and is a proof-of-stake protocol. Similar to "
"Ethereum, a contract starts out in one state, many nodes receive a "
"signed transaction, and then their RhoVM instances execute that contract "
"to its next state. An array of node operators, or \"bonded validators\" "
"apply the consensus algorithm to crypto-economically verify that the "
"entire history of state configurations and state transitions, of the "
"RhoVM instance, are accurately replicated in a distributed data store."

"The blockchain contracts (aka smart contracts, processes, or programs), "
"including system contracts included in the installation are written in "
"the RChain general-purpose language “**Rholang**” (Reflective higher-"
"order language). Derived from the rho-calculus computational formalism, "
"Rholang supports internal programmatic concurrency. It formally "
"expresses the communication and coordination of many processes executing "
"in parallel composition. Rholang naturally accommodates industry trends "
"in code mobility, reactive/monadic API’s, parallelism, asynchronicity, "
"and behavioral types."
